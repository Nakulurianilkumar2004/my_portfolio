        <p>
          I'm a passionate Frontend Developer with strong expertise in building responsive and interactive web applications using React.js.

          Alongside frontend development, I'm deeply driven by my ambition to become an AI Engineer.

          I'm committed to bridging the gap between powerful AI solutions and intuitive user interfaces. 
          Every project I take on pushes me closer to my vision of creating smart, user-centric applications that can make a real impact.
